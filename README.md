# w03_portfolio_with_bootstrap


## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for week 3. It requires us to (re)create (from our week 2 challenge) a portfoliio web page using bootstrap css. The Bootstrap

This week, we learnt (and had lots of fun) with CSS Flexbox and Grids. We also learnt the concept of wire-framing (which was a process I used to do on pencil and paper). 

Through this project, I have an opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of HTML/CSS, the git workflow, github, terminal commands, VSCode, editing a markdown document and debuging using browser developer mode. I have also had a lot of fun playing with CSS flexbox and animation functionality.  

I have learnt that I need to have an even more comprehensive wire-framing right down to the details of the naming for the major flex box containers, items and the transition of the webpage from a large screen to small(er) screens. I have also learnt the importance of understanding behaviours of different browsers as some of the animations did not work on Mac/iOS/iPadOS Safari browser nor did it work on iOS/iPadOS Chrome browser. I think this is extremely important for designing a responsive website with a target user in mind.

This project takes the "mobile last" approach as it is anticipated that recruiting agents are more likely to be using a laptop/desktop or a larger tablet than on a mobile.

We were given 1 less day to complete this week's challenge owing to the pending Christmas break. So I had to manage my time properly. I also need further readings about accessibility in web design and browser compatibiliity.

Other than the first project listed in the portfolio section of my webpage, the rest of the projects are all fictitious or website / apps that I would love to have made. 


### Wireframe of this Portfolio Showcase Webpage

### Methodology

* Make the changes and follow a git workflow.
* Make a wireframe design for large screen and smaller tablets and mobile screens. This should identify:
  ** all the css flexboxes, their properties/values, 
  ** how they will trasition from big screen to small screens and
  ** all the accessiblity issues relating to the webpage and all its transitions required for making the website responsive. 
* Provide content for copy writings and images for the projects.



### Further Issues Requiring Attention

* Update all the links with real links.
* Implement cookie consent and check compliance with GDPR.
* Create the script(s) need to collect email leads from the contact me section.
* Smooth out the current transition from larger screens to smaller screen vice versa.
* Use of svg image animation in different browsers.

I WANT an online portfolio that follows accessibility standards and SEO
SO THAT potential hiring agents can look at previous work and be impressed enough to contact me.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards by having the following:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

* CSS animation in profile avatar in the contact me section.
