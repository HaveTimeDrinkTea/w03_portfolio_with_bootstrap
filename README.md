# w03_portfolio_with_bootstrap


## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for week 3. It requires us to (re)create (from our week 2 challenge) a portfoliio web page using bootstrap css. Bootstrap version 4.6 is used in this project.

This week, we learnt about the wonders of Bootstrap. Through this project, I have an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to recreate a webpage using Bootstrap. I have also anchored my understanding of HTML/CSS, the git workflow, github, terminal commands, VSCode, editing a markdown document and debuging using browser developer mode. I have also had a lot of fun researching and creating artwork using CSS and CSS animation functionalities.  

As with the last project, this project takes the "mobile last" approach as it is anticipated that recruiting agents are more likely to be using a laptop/desktop or a larger tablet than on a mobile. But using Bootstrap makes it so much easier.

Other than the first project listed in the portfolio section of my webpage, the rest of the projects are all fictitious or website / apps that I would love to have made.

## User Story

AS A new frontend developer
I WANT an online portfolio that follows accessibility standards and SEO
SO THAT potential hiring agents can look at previous work and be impressed enough to contact me.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards by having the following:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Features

* Web page to showcase 
  ** my design aesthetic and knowledge of HTML/CSS
  ** my (future) project porfolio 
* As the header section includes some css animation, I've added @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) to honour devices with reduced motion settings.
* CSS animations in the header section (does not work on macOS Ventura / iPaadOs / iOS safari).  Tested and worked in Google Chrome
* CSS animation in profile avatar in the contact me section.
