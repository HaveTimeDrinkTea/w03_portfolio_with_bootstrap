# w03_portfolio_with_bootstrap


## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for week 3 "UX and Advance CSS Bootstrap Portfolio". It requires us to (re)create (from our week 2 challenge) a portfoliio web page using bootstrap css. Bootstrap version 4.6 is used in this project.

This week, we learnt about the wonders of Bootstrap. Through this project, I have an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to recreate a webpage using Bootstrap. I have also anchored my understanding of HTML/CSS, the git workflow, github, terminal commands, VSCode, editing a markdown document and debuging using browser developer mode. I have also had a lot of fun researching and creating artwork using CSS and CSS animation functionalities.  

As with the last project, this project takes the "mobile last" approach as it is anticipated that recruiting agents are more likely to be using a laptop/desktop or a larger tablet than a mobile. Bootstrap makes it so much easier to make the webpage responsive.

Other than the first project listed in the portfolio section of my webpage, the rest of the projects are all fictitious or website / apps that I would love to have made.
